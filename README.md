Description:
  Hello and thank you for visiting this site, here I have created a database and record storage of Different Recipes and their creators. With added classifications of Meal of the day, Holiday, and Season that the recipe belongs to. The Creator records house the info of the creator name along with the classes, while the recipe stores the recipe name. Through thsi three added tables are generated, the Meal of the day, Seasonal Meal, and Holiday Meal Tables. An added funstion is the use of an API to manipulate the records in Json. To access the API interactive page type in the browser of the Home screen "/swagger/index.html". Thank you for visiting and expirementing with the site, have a wonderful day.
